# ICDM-22--MR-GNAS

Official Pytorch implementation of ICDM'22 "Multi-Relational Graph Neural Architecture Search with Fine-grained Message Passing"

To tackle the limitations of single-relational setting and coarse-grained search space design in existing graph NAS, in this paper, we propose a novel framework of multirelational graph neural architecture search, dubbed MR-GNAS, to automatically develop innovative and excellent multi-relational GNN architectures.
